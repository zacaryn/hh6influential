        <h1>HH6 Influential â€“ Terms of Service & Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <p className="intro">These Terms govern all projects and services provided by HH6 Influential. Please read them carefully.</p>

        <ol className="terms-list">
          <li>
            <h3>Scope of Work</h3>
            <p>
              Projects are defined by a written proposal outlining features, deliverables, and pricing. Requests outside of the agreed scope will be billed separately. A 30 day post-launch grace period is included for minor updates within scope. After this, updates are billed hourly or under a retainer.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Payment Terms</h3>
            <p>
              A 50% deposit is required before work begins. Remaining balances are due upon project completion and prior to launch. Hosting, maintenance, and retainers are billed in advance and non-refundable once active. Unpaid balances over 15 days may result in suspension of services.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Hosting & Domains</h3>
            <p>
              Hosting covers server space, SSL, backups, and monitoring. Maintenance packages include updates and light content posting. Domains managed by HH6 are billed annually. Client-managed domains are their responsibility. Migration of a website from HH6 hosting incurs an hourly migration fee.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Cancellations & Termination</h3>
