# HH6 Influential Website â€“ Internal Overview

This repository contains the production website for HH6 Influential. It is a Next.js application with a lightweight Express API service used for admin functionality, blog content management, and AWS integrations. The codebase emphasizes performance, maintainability, and strong on-page SEO for digital marketing services.

## What was built

- **Responsive marketing website** with service-specific content (Web Design, Graphic Design, Video Editing, SEO Marketing, Social Media, Web Hosting, Webmaster Services)
- **Conversion paths**: contact forms and QuickMessageWidget for lead capture
- **Admin dashboard** for blog content management and inquiry handling (Cognito-protected)
- **Blog system** with dynamic routing and AWS S3/CloudFront integration
- **Robust SEO implementation** (Next.js metadata API, Open Graph, Twitter cards, JSON-LD)
- **Production-ready architecture** with separate frontend/backend deployment structure

## Tech stack

- **Next.js (App Router)**, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Express.js API service** in `/server/` directory for production deployment
- **AWS**: S3 (blog content), CloudFront (CDN), Cognito (admin auth), DynamoDB (inquiries)
- **Development**: Concurrent frontend/backend with `start-prod.js` orchestration

## Architecture highlights

- **UI**: `src/app/` directory with route-level metadata and JSON-LD where appropriate
- **Global SEO**: `src/app/layout.tsx` sets defaults (Open Graph, Twitter, verification, WebSite/Organization schema)
- **Components**: reusable UI in `src/components/` (FAQ, forms, navigation, etc.)
- **API service**: `server/server.js` exposes `/api/*` routes, integrates with AWS, includes CORS and JWT verification
- **Static assets and SEO files**: `public/` (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, manifests, images)
- **Production separation**: `/server/` directory mimics production deployment with its own dependencies

## SEO implementation

- **Next.js Metadata API** for titles/descriptions per page and Open Graph/Twitter tags
- **Structured data**: WebSite, Organization, WebPage, FAQPage, and relevant ImageObject JSON-LD
- **Canonicals and site name**: configured to the apex domain; alternateName provided to reinforce brand sitename in Google
- **robots and sitemap**: explicit robots.txt and sitemap.xml maintained in `public/`
- **Prerender.io integration** for SEO rendering of dynamic content

## Deployment notes

- **Frontend**: Next.js build deployed behind Nginx with 301 redirect from www to apex domain
- **Backend**: Express API service deployed separately with AWS credentials and environment variables
- **CDN**: CloudFront distribution for blog content and static assets
- **Environment variables**: Separate `.env.production` files for frontend and backend
- **Image optimization**: Static assets served from `public/` directory

## Environment/configuration

- **next.config.ts**: site URL configured, image domains set for AWS S3
- **server/server.js**: expects AWS credentials, Cognito configuration, and CORS settings
- **Production setup**: `/server/` directory with its own `package.json` and dependencies
- **Development**: Root directory contains both frontend and backend for local development

## Payment Structure

- **Web Design**: 50% deposit required before work begins, final payment due upon completion
- **All other services** (Graphic Design, Video Editing, etc.): Hourly billing, payment upon project completion
- **Terms**: Detailed in `/src/app/terms/page.jsx`
